# Drive-PDF-Library
Library for your pdf files on google drive.

Welcome to my first project, mind that because code may be a little messy :)

Account system is from: https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-mysql-login-system.php

For setting it up I just put the source code of the folder pdflibrary into the Apache folder in Xampp.
Then to setup the database (which is needed because the website uses a login sistem) import pdflibrary.sql.
Have fun!
