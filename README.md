# Drive-PDF-Library
Library for your pdf files on google drive.

Welcome to my first project, mind that because code may be a little messy :)

For setting it up I just put the source code of the folder pdflibrary into the Apache folder in Xampp.
Then to setup the database (which is needed because the website uses a login sistem) import the database found in pdf_library_sql.rar.
Have fun!
